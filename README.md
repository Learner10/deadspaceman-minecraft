# DeadSpaceman Minecraft Modpack

This is the repository for the Dead Spaceman minecraft modpack.

## Installing

1. Download [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download), a tool for managing multiple minecraft installations and modpacks. Extract the folder to a directory of your choosing, and run ``MultiMC.exe``
    * Select your preferred language
    * Select a Java 1.8 installation, and set the default RAM allocation. You will generally want to increase this. Depending on how much RAM you have, allocating 4-6 gigabytes is not a bad idea. Those with higher end machines can allocate higher amounts, but there are diminishing returns as Java garbage collection starts to cause performance issues at high RAM allocation.
2. Click 'Add Instance' in your MultiMC launcher, select 'Import from zip' on the left-hand side of the window, and enter ``https://github.com/bobbahbrown/deadspaceman-minecraft/releases/latest/download/deadspaceman-minecraft.zip``
3. Launch the installed instance
